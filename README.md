# csxarch
A 64-bit "mainframe" instruction set architecture and emulator

About time this made it to GitHub so I can stop emailing myself zip files.
See the WIP programmer's manual: [docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FRtgmhZcXYOHcmnsmvSpPKFKg-cI92IbCzpo0QVvzX0/edit)

## Build instructions
`make` (requires GNU make)

## Run
run `./obj/csxarch`

## Infrequently Asked Questions
### Q: Why are you using GNU make extensions? My system will only run pure POSIX make!
A: Do not attempt to run `csxarch` on a bagel, please upgrade to at least a VAX-11 (1977) and install at least gmake 1.0
